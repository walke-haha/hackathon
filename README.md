Contact@IIIT: A Web-Based Database Management System

Contact@IIIT is a web-based database management system designed and developed by three students to search, add, edit, and manage student and faculty data stored in a dataset. The web application uses Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement its functionalities.

Functionality:
Contact@IIIT is a user-friendly web application that allows users to add new students or faculty to the database. The system also has a search function that enables users to search and display the profile data on the page for both students and faculty. The display feature shows the data of students and faculty, and users can delete the data if needed. The system also has an editing feature that allows users to edit the contact directory from user-inputted data.

Adding New Entries:
Users can add new student or faculty entries by providing necessary details such as name, email, phone number, qualifications, and faculty ID. The input is validated before being added to the database to prevent errors or malicious input.

Searching and Displaying:
Contact@IIIT allows users to search and display student or faculty data by providing their name or faculty ID. The system queries the database and retrieves the relevant data, which is then displayed on the page. Users can view the profile information and delete the data if required.

Editing:
Contact@IIIT provides users with an editing feature to update and edit the contact directory based on user input. Users can modify or update the data of a particular entry, which is then reflected in the database.

Framework and Packages:
Contact@IIIT is built using Flask, a web framework in Python, and uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for front-end development. The application uses SQLite3, a lightweight database engine, to store the data.

Setting up on someone else's computer:
To set up Contact@IIIT on someone else's computer, the user should first extract the zip file and enter the directory. The user should then run x.py to create the database and app1.py to generate the link to the website. The user can then access the website by going to the generated link and interact with the database.

Contributions:
Contact@IIIT was developed by three students, each contributing to the project in their respective ways. Sama Walke focused on the front-end development and the display page of the web application, while Kriti M worked on back-end development using Flask and database management using SQLite3 for the insert into database and styling and editing the search page. Mayank Mittal focused on the search page and the edit page using Flask.

In conclusion, Contact@IIIT is a web-based database management system that makes it easy to search, add, edit, and manage student and faculty data stored in a dataset. Its user-friendly interface and functionalities make it a useful tool for managing contacts and data at IIIT. With its efficient framework and ease of use, Contact@IIIT is an excellent resource for any academic institution looking to manage its database effectively.
